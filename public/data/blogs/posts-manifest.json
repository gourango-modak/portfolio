      "description": "Before we explore Redis specifically, let’s establish what we mean by push and pull replication models.\n\nPull-based replication: Replicas periodically ask the master, “What’s new?” The replica is responsible for fetching updates. Think of it like checking your mailbox; you decide when to check, and you pull out whatever’s there.\n\nRedis uses the push model. When a write command is executed on the master, Redis propagates that command to all connected replicas immediately (or as immediately as the network allows).",
